# Penny-Gemstone
Penny Gemstone, The 3DPrinted (FDM, SLA versions seperate) Vacuum fill fountain pen :)


To assemble th FDM:
You'll need:
3ML Syringe (Future versions might find a way to bypass this? the o-ring shape is impossbile to find outside of Mac_Masster Carr)

this wasn't tested, I live in iran so I can't show you mine, but They're appearntly standardizes, 10.5mm outside, 8.5-9~mm inside.

(Optional, FDM ONLY): A tube (PETG/ACRYLIC/PC, keep in mind acrylic is appearntly fragile) with the appropriate outside/inside diam (current version is made for 8.5mm~ inside, 10.5mm outside syringe. since you have bought the syringe for it's O-Ring, you might as well rub off the lettering and cut the handle/tip of and use it as a tube, it's not very visable unless you want to leave it visable. Up to you!

Copper/Stainless steel or other water resitant tube/rods. 3mm diam. Buy an optional m3 die if you want the assembly to not be permanent. tho friction fit works great for FDM. (57.5mm for the stock stl files)

Nib/Feed: Platnium Preppy (it writes wetter with this pen) or Pilot Kakuno. Message me/request files for your fav foutnain pen nib. please don't choose hard to design for ones! KAWECO is incredibly simple to design for yet unavailable in my country. buy me one or simply measure me one so I design one for you :) but i recommend you to try the preppy first. it works way nicer than it does in it's own body now that it writes wetter! Pilot kakuno is also awesome. sadly I only have the SLA versio so far ;s and i'm too scared to try to test fit it again in FDM. stupid me didn't save the files... Message me if you're willig to test fit it :)

O-Rings: 7mm outside 3mm inside for plunger (buy many anwyays, you need 2 tho)
10mm inside 14mm outside O-rings for the handles. video uses 10-15 which is a bit ugly.

you can alernatively cast all these in RTV Silicone at home which isn't super hard if you 3DPrint the mold, don't use silicone grease in case you do, use appearntly vaseline works but eats ABS so be sure to use PETG/PLA.

FDM Parts: I recommend 0.12mm for all parts. I'd use PETG. but I used PLA.

100% Silicone grease/O-ring grease. Lubrication is NOT OPTIONAL! (unless you enjoy leaks/inky hands :P). for silicone use PTFE grease/superlube/vaseline, hasn't been tested by me sadly due to limited parts available in Iran.


That's it. ink capacity is customizable. stock included .STL for a syringe are approximately 3ml-2.5ml. the one shown in the video holds 4ml which is insane and uncessary so I made it smaller, and added a double seal o-ring in the slot for safety :)

To make (FDM):

Cut your Syringe/Tube to the right size (37mm for STL) and chamfer the inside of one end, mark that end, this insures that pulling the plunger is effortless. Test it with the oneway valve before Glueing together

Take out the syringe o-ring and cut the closed of portion of the O-Ring with a razor, you might need to try twice to get it right but it's easy, slight back and forth with light pressure instead of forcing it. The end should be relatively flat and open for fluid and air to flow trough. Put it with the non-cut side facing the Closed part of the one way valve. Glue it to the rod you have. test it with the chamfered syringe. the barrel has an additional chamfer, but it's important to not skip this step regardless lubricate the One way valve file before putting on the o-ring. Afterwards. try it in the syringe to make sure directional changes moves the O-Ring into the correct position.

cut the Barrel STL at the desired location in your slicer. print the top with the bigger round portion touchign the plate. If you're not a fan of my gap-see trough design, it won't matter you can shit it with glue and it'll not be a visable seam with most filaments (specially translucent), pushign the Syringe in in the first prototype was annoying so I did this. After doing this, use any glue you trust (I recommend epoxy tbh) and rub it around the body of the syringe/tube without getting it inside, a light coat on some parts is all that's needed to create a seal. push it in both ends and align it, I recomment a test fit and checking before you try it. While doing this, I recommend you to coat the PLA part for aesthetical purposes if you wish to do so, use a high quality resin and preferrabily a UV one. 


set the Barrel to cure/harden. Keep in mind superglue cures fast usually and doesn't give you much of a chance to adjust, additionally, unless you cover the exposed portion with tape precisely (if you plan on exposing it) you might get superglue there and it'll look ugly, resin however makes it look prettier if anything to have the syringe coated in a light layer of it!

Force 2 7mm-3mm o-ring inside the bottom slot one on top of another, this might take a bit of effort but shouldn't be SUPER hard.

after it's hardened, lubricate the outer O-ring on the one way valve, and insert it trough the hole meant for the handle. then pass it trough the top hole.

If you bought a die, cut threads into the top of the rod that's cut to the correct length, then screw it into the handle. If not, wack it into the rod with a hammer, be careful to not break things, you can use your hands, it shouldn't be insanely hard, can use hot glue to create a semi-permanent stronger connection!

Put the 10mm ID o-ring onto the handle, apply grease to the O-ring and the threads (don't get greedy!) and screw it in tight, since this is an FDM version, do'nt worry about destroying the threads, this isn't brittle, screw it firMLY!

before inserting the nib, apply soapy water to the entire unit expect the nib's hole. then blow very hard into the hole. if there's a leak it should bubble, if not proceed, if it does leak, fix it!) 

if it works, try it! without a nib/feed. try to put it inside water (with food coloring to see if anyting's happenign) and push the plunger down confidently, changing the direction of the push opens the seal and ruins it.

you should get a sploosh of ink wooshing up fast, it might fall right down after since the hole is too big to keep water inside.
